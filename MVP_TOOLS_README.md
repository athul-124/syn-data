# MVP Development Tools

A comprehensive toolkit implementing the **Strategic Blueprint for Minimum Viable Product Development** methodology. These tools support the complete MVP journey from discovery to iteration, following the build-measure-learn feedback loop.

## 🎯 Overview

This toolkit provides practical implementation of the MVP Strategic Blueprint, offering:

- **Feature Prioritization** using MoSCoW and RICE scoring methods
- **User Research Management** for personas, user stories, and insights
- **Progress Tracking** through MVP development phases
- **Feedback Collection & Analysis** for the build-measure-learn loop
- **Unified Dashboard** for comprehensive project oversight

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Initialize Your MVP Project

```bash
# Initialize new project with sample data (recommended for learning)
python mvp_cli.py init "My MVP Project" --sample

# Or initialize empty project
python mvp_cli.py init "My MVP Project"
```

### 2. Check Project Status

```bash
python mvp_cli.py status
```

### 3. View Different Aspects

```bash
# Feature prioritization
python mvp_cli.py features

# User feedback analysis
python mvp_cli.py feedback

# Development progress
python mvp_cli.py progress

# Action items
python mvp_cli.py actions
```

### 4. Generate Reports

```bash
# Generate comprehensive report
python mvp_cli.py report

# Generate with custom filename
python mvp_cli.py report --output my_mvp_report.json
```

## 📊 Tool Components

### 1. Feature Prioritization (`feature_prioritization.py`)

Implements the MoSCoW method and RICE scoring model for systematic feature prioritization.

**Key Features:**
- **MoSCoW Categories**: Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have, Won't-Have
- **RICE Scoring**: Reach × Impact × Confidence / Effort
- **MVP Scope Definition**: Automatic identification of MVP features
- **Export Capabilities**: JSON and CSV export for sharing

**Example Usage:**
```python
from mvp_tools.feature_prioritization import FeaturePrioritizer, Feature, Priority

prioritizer = FeaturePrioritizer()

# Add a feature
feature = Feature(
    id="F001",
    name="User Authentication",
    description="Basic login/logout functionality",
    user_story="As a user, I want to log in so that I can access my data",
    moscow_priority=Priority.MUST_HAVE,
    reach=8, impact=7, confidence=9, effort=4
)
prioritizer.add_feature(feature)

# Get MVP features
mvp_features = prioritizer.get_mvp_features()
```

### 2. User Research Management (`user_research.py`)

Manages user personas, user stories, and research insights following Phase I of the Strategic Blueprint.

**Key Features:**
- **Detailed User Personas**: Demographics, psychographics, pain points, goals
- **User Story Management**: Standard format with acceptance criteria
- **Research Insights**: Capture findings from interviews, surveys, analytics
- **Analysis & Reporting**: Aggregate insights and identify patterns

**Example Usage:**
```python
from mvp_tools.user_research import UserResearchManager, UserPersona, UserSegment

manager = UserResearchManager()

# Create a persona
persona = UserPersona(
    id="P001",
    name="Sarah Chen",
    segment=UserSegment.DATA_SCIENTIST,
    age_range="28-35",
    job_title="Senior Data Scientist",
    goals=["Build ML models with limited data", "Ensure data privacy"],
    pain_points=["Insufficient training data", "Privacy regulations"]
)
manager.add_persona(persona)
```

### 3. Progress Tracking (`progress_tracker.py`)

Tracks development progress through MVP phases with tasks, milestones, and metrics.

**Key Features:**
- **Phase-Based Tracking**: Discovery → Prioritization → Development → Testing → Launch → Iteration
- **Task Management**: Status tracking, dependencies, effort estimation
- **Milestone Tracking**: Success criteria, target dates, completion status
- **Metrics Monitoring**: KPIs with targets and progress tracking

**Example Usage:**
```python
from mvp_tools.progress_tracker import MVPProgressTracker, Task, MVPPhase, TaskStatus

tracker = MVPProgressTracker("My MVP Project")

# Add a task
task = Task(
    id="T001",
    name="Implement API endpoint",
    description="Create REST API for data processing",
    phase=MVPPhase.DEVELOPMENT,
    status=TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS,
    estimated_hours=16
)
tracker.add_task(task)

# Get progress report
report = tracker.generate_status_report()
```

### 4. Feedback System (`feedback_system.py`)

Implements the "measure" and "learn" components of the build-measure-learn feedback loop.

**Key Features:**
- **Feedback Collection**: Multiple sources (interviews, surveys, support tickets)
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Track user satisfaction trends
- **Theme Identification**: Automatically identify common issues
- **Insight Generation**: Convert feedback into actionable insights
- **Prioritization**: Impact vs. effort analysis for feedback items

**Example Usage:**
```python
from mvp_tools.feedback_system import FeedbackManager, UserFeedback, FeedbackType

manager = FeedbackManager()

# Add feedback
feedback = UserFeedback(
    id="FB001",
    title="Upload fails for large files",
    description="CSV upload times out for files > 50MB",
    feedback_type=FeedbackType.BUG_REPORT,
    impact_score=4,
    effort_to_fix=3
)
manager.add_feedback(feedback)

# Analyze feedback
analysis = manager.analyze_feedback()
```

### 5. MVP Dashboard (`mvp_dashboard.py`)

Unified dashboard providing comprehensive project oversight and executive reporting.

**Key Features:**
